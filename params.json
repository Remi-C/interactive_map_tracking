{"name":"Interactive map tracking","tagline":"A QGIS 2.6 plugin to track camera of user , AND/OR to autocommit/refresh edit on PostGIS vector layer","body":" \r\nThis plug-in was designed to \r\n* allow __concurrent editing awareness or history of editing__ (tracking)\r\n* enable QGIS to play well with PostGIS database that use trigger to __reconstruct geometry on the fly__\r\n \r\n\r\n###feature\r\nThis plug-in adds 2 features to QGIS, the user choose what feature he uses\r\n\r\n####tracking the position \r\n* each time the user change its position on QGIS map canvas (aka camera position), the screen rectangle is saved along with a user id and a timestamp. That is, if the user zoom level is sufficient (it is a parameter)\r\n* with correct QGIS styling, this enable to see : \r\n  + where the other users __are editing__ so two people won't hopefully edit the same area\r\n  + where the other users (and self) __were editing__, so an user won't come and edit the same area twice\r\n* Moreover, this tracking data can be analysed to produce : \r\n  + a map of editing time (gives the place where editing was short/long)\r\n  + Reliable stats on editing time and area edited per user, which is essential in a benchmark\r\n\r\n####autosave and refresh after an edit\r\n* QGIS uses a sophisticated Do/Undo mechanism with a delayed writing system. However, when working with a data base that generates geometry on the fly (trigger), it is essential to commit each change immediately.\r\n* The plug-in does exactly that : each modification (geometry or attribute) is saved immediately to the layer, and the canvas is re-rendered.\r\n* this instantaneous commit allow to __create new user interaction__ that are within the database, as opposed to be within QGIS. Thus, this interactions can be used in other GIS software, and can be much more complex.\r\n\r\n \r\n##Configure the plug-in\r\n\r\nThere are very little parameters to this plugin.\r\n\r\n__By default the plug-in does nothing__ ! \r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that for the tracking you have to select a compatible layer to write the tracking information.\r\nThe layer can be any qgis vector layer type,  \r\nbut it must has __at least__ (other attributes will be filed with null) :   \r\n* A column `user_id` of type text\r\n* A column `w_time` of type text (but following the iso format for time, for usage)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo control the plugin, click on the plug-in icon that has been added to QGIS icons when installing the plug-in.\r\n[[/images/plugin/logo_LQ.png]]\r\n\r\nThen configure the parameters : \r\n[[/images/plugin/GUI_of_plugin_explained.png]]\r\n\r\nAs a regular user, you shouldn't use the last tab (dev).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Using the plug-in\r\n###Tracking\r\nWhen the tracking is activated, the position of the screen will be saved automatically every time you change you screen position in QGIS, if you are close enough (depending on the parameter).\r\nEach screen geometry saved also has a user-id given by your computer, as well as a time of saving.\r\n\r\n[[/images/plugin/principle_of_tracking.png]]\r\n\r\nBoth of this attributes can be used to display who did what and when within QGIS, or even create a map of editing time\r\n\r\n###Coloring camera tracking layer\r\n#### coloring camera tracking with time\r\n - edit style of layer\r\n - choose graduated\r\n - paste ` todatetime(\"w_time\")` in column field\r\n - click button class\r\n![coloring camera position](https://github.com/Remi-C/street_gen/blob/master/gui/doc/doc_github/coloring_camera_position.png)\r\n\r\n#### coloring camera tracking with user_id\r\n - edit style of layer\r\n - choose graduated or classified\r\n - paste ` tostring(\"user_id\")` in column field\r\n - click button class\r\n![coloring camera position](https://github.com/Remi-C/street_gen/blob/master/gui/doc/doc_github/coloring_camera_position_by_user_id.png)\r\n\r\n### Auto save and refresh feature\r\nThis feature can only be used on PostGIS vector layers, because it wouldn't make much sense elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWhen activated, each edition (geometry or attribute) that you perform on a PostGIS vector layer is instantaneously saved, and QGIS display is refreshed afterward.  \r\nThis behaviour skip the whole Do/Undo QGIS feature, but allow to use on-the-fly generation of geometry in database.\r\n\r\n[[/images/plugin/auto_save_combined.png]]\r\n \r\n###Creating an edition-duration map\r\nYou can create an edition-duration map, see [[Using a PostGIS layer for tracking|[User]-Advanced-Tracking-with-a-PostGIS-layer]]\r\n\r\n##Using the plug-in : Limitations\r\n* tracking\r\n  - when the tracking layer is not diplayed, no tracking\r\n  - because the plug-in writes each camera position, it may slow navigation when using a lot of scroll/unscroll\r\n  - In certain condition, non metric coordinates could cause weird behavior\r\n* Autosave/refresh\r\n  - The Do/Undo feature can't be used\r\n  -  when using the node tool, auto saving will loose the selection of nodes \r\n\r\n##Improving the plug-in \r\nThis is an open source project, any test/idea/contribution is welcome.\r\n","google":"UA-60271234-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
