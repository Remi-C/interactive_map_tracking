That is, if the user zoom level is compatible with edition (parameter)\r\n* with correct QGIS styling, this enable to see : \r\n  + where the other users __are editing__ so two people won't hopefully edit the same area\r\n  + where the other users (and self) __were editing__, so an user won't come and edit the same area twice\r\n* Moreover, this tracking data can be analysed to produce : \r\n  + a map of editing time (gives the place where editing was short/long)\r\n  + Reliable stats on editing time and area edited per user, which is essential in a benchmark\r\n\r\n####autosave and refresh after an edit\r\n* QGIS uses a sophisticated Do/Undo mechanism with a delayed writing system. However, when working with a data base that generates geometry on the fly (trigger), it is essential to commit each change immediately.\r\n* The plug-in does exactly that : each modification (geometry or attribute) is saved immediately to the layer, and the canvas is re-rendered.\r\n* this instantaneous commit allow to __create new user interaction__ that are within the database, as opposed to be within QGIS. Thus, this interactions can be used in other GIS software, and can be much more complex.\r\n \r\n","google":"60271234","note":"Don't delete this file!
